        <p> But existing is basically all I do! Shut up and take my money! Nay, I           respectand admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own         Oscar. Bender, you risked your life to save me! One hundred dollars.
            <br/><br>
            Look, last night was a mistake. No, just a regular mistake. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! When will that be?
        
            Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop.

            Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! It doesn't look so shiny to me. I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.
            <br><br>
            Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? Now what? Bite my shiny metal ass. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.
        
            Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Daylight and everything. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

            I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. Can I use the gun? It doesn't look so shiny to me. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.
            <br> <br>
            I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.

            In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!

            I had more, but you go ahead. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Kids have names? She also liked to shut up!

            Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! No. We're on the top. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?
            <br><br>
            Hey, guess what you're accessories to. The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!

            Really?! Moving alongâ€¦ Soothe us with sweet lies. One hundred dollars.

            Now what? You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Can we have Bender Burgers again?

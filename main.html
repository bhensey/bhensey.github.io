        <p> But existing is basically all I do! Shut up and take my money! Nay, I respect     and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.           Bender, you risked your life to save me! One hundred dollars.

            Look, last night was a mistake. No, just a regular mistake. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! When will that be?

            Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop.

            Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! It doesn't look so shiny to me. I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.

            Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? Now what? Bite my shiny metal ass. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.</p>
